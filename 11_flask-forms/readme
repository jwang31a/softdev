DISCO:
even though request is a module, it seems that we can still print it
request also has several parameters, like .args or .headers
.args seems to be an array or maybe even a dictionary?
  when we request username, it prints the value associated with it, which is the user submitted one
we also discovered that we can show different information on the webpage based on what the user submits as the username
the methods array can be put into app.route() as a parameter
we think get means showing information to the user, so getting from the backend?
the submitted username will show up in the url

QCC:
when we uncommented out the print(request.args['username']) in the disp_loginpage() function, we got an error
  we think this is because the username doesn't exist yet since the user didn't submit it through the form
we're not sure what post means, but we think it has something to do with sending information back to the server based on what we think get does
