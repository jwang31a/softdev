# how-to :: Make better forms
---
## Overview
There are many features in real forms that we haven't touched upon, and these could come in useful for the user experience, as well as more customization. 

### Estimated Time Cost: x.x hrs (round to nearest 0.1)

### Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of how forms work (and maybe CSS for styling)
- Have a browser and text editor available

1. Create required files (.html file required, .css optional)
1. Setup the html file, it should look something like this
```
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<form action="">
			<label>name</label>
			<input type="name" name="Submit"></input>
			<input type="submit" name="Submit">
		</form>
	</body>
</html>
```
