K32 -- JS bounce
2023-04-26w

DISCO:
* functions can be inside functions
* images are objects in JS

QCC:
* I left e.preventDefault() commented out because I was getting a TypeError. 
* e.preventDefault prevents the default behavior, from happening, but what would the default behavior be for a clear function? (or a button?)
* how are nested functions different from helper functions? is it like nested classes in java, which can access variables from the class around it?
