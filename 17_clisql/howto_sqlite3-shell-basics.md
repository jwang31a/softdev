To open sqlite, you have to type sqlite3 in the terminal  
Make sure to put a semicolon at the end of every command line  
.tables shows the tables that you have created  
CREATE TABLE name (name TEXT, id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) creates a table  
name is the header for the name and id is the header for values  
INSERT into name VALUES () adds a name and value to the table  
SELECT * FROM name; displays the table  
The table is like a csv file, but with a | instead of a comma  
SELECT name FROM nameoftable displays all the names. If we do id instead of name, we get the values  
You can filter results with WHERE at the end of SELECT  
.mode changes the way the results are displayed  
.header toggles the column name
