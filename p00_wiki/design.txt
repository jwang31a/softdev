Python file will contain code for running the app, rendering a template that will be the main page. 
That rendered html file will display text, with a button to change to another page that displays an editable version of that text (using contenteditable attribute?). 
 - if user wants to update the page, then the text in the html file will be updated directly?
Backend storage will be sqlite: 
 - 2 types of accounts (for now hard coded), admin and user
  - admin can edit, user can only view (for now)
 - not for file storage (like the displayed text)
 
Sitemap: 
 - main page that displays all the text/information (maybe with a search feature)
  - login with a form requesting username and password on the side
 - edit page that displays editable text (only admin can edit)

  - if login succeeds, then admin will be able to access the edit page
